# import turtle
# tim = turtle.Turtle()

# from turtle import Turtle
# tim = Turtle()

# from turtle import *
# tim = Turtle()
# # this forn of importing modules is not common because it can cause confusion

# import turtle as t
# tim = t.Turtle()
# # it is also a good practice to give an alias to the module we use to avoid long typing
